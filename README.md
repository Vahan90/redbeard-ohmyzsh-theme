# redbeard for oh-my-zsh

redbeard is a [oh-my-zsh shell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) theme based directly on
the famous default robbyrussell theme

I basically added some changes to it so it reflects simple parts that I like.
- Starts with a lambda sign.
- Lambda sign turns red if the return statement of last command is not 0.
- it shows you your git status and git branch if you're inside a repo.
- also the way it displays the user name and host name, and current directory you are in is my preferred method
